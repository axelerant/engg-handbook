# Adopt Angular for Frontend Development

## Context

We need a robust frontend framework that can support the development of our large-scale web applications. The framework should have strong community support, comprehensive tooling, and the ability to integrate well with our existing backend services.

## Decision

After evaluating several options, including React, Vue.js, and Angular, we have decided to adopt Angular for the following reasons:

- **Comprehensive Tooling:** Angular comes with a complete suite of tools, including a powerful CLI, which streamlines the development process.
- **Strong Typing with TypeScript:** Angular's use of TypeScript helps in catching errors early in the development cycle and makes the code more maintainable.
- **Suitability for Large-Scale Applications:** Angular's modular architecture and extensive built-in features make it well-suited for large, complex applications.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Improved code quality and maintainability due to TypeScript.
  - Enhanced productivity with Angular's CLI and built-in tools.
  - Better performance and scalability for large applications.
- **Negative:**
  - Steeper learning curve for developers new to Angular.
  - Potential refactoring of existing codebases to integrate with Angular.

## Status

- **Proposed**
