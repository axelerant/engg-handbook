# ADRs

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the course of a project. They are used to document the reasoning behind a particular decision, the alternatives considered, and the consequences of the decision. This structured documentation helps in maintaining a history of decisions, understanding the rationale behind them, and communicating them effectively to the team.

## Why Use ADRs?

1. **Documentation of Decisions**: ADRs provide a formal way to document significant architectural decisions.
2. **Historical Context**: They help in understanding the historical context of decisions.
3. **Consistency**: ADRs ensure that decisions are consistently communicated across the team.
4. **Onboarding**: They assist new team members in understanding the architectural choices made in the project.
5. **Decision Rationale**: ADRs capture the rationale behind decisions, helping in future decision-making processes.

## Structure of an ADR

An ADR typically includes the following sections:

1. **Title**: A clear and concise title for the decision.
2. **Date**: The date when the decision was made.
3. **Status**: The current status of the decision (e.g., proposed, accepted, deprecated).
4. **Context**: A brief explanation of the situation that led to the need for the decision.
5. **Decision**: The decision that was made.
6. **Consequences**: The outcomes and consequences of the decision.
7. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered and why they were not chosen.
