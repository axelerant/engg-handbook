# Drupal 9

## Context

Our current Drupal 8 installation needs an upgrade to ensure continued support and access to the latest features and security updates.

## Decision

We will upgrade our CMS to Drupal 9. The decision to upgrade is based on:

- **End of Life for Drupal 8:** Drupal 8 will no longer receive official support, making it imperative to upgrade.
- **Enhanced Features and Security:** Drupal 9 offers new features, improvements, and enhanced security measures.
- **Compatibility:** The upgrade path from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9 is straightforward due to backward compatibility.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Continued support and security updates from the Drupal community.
  - Access to new features and improvements in Drupal 9.
  - Improved performance and scalability.
- **Negative:**
  - Time and effort required to perform the upgrade.
  - Potential compatibility issues with existing modules and custom code.

## Status

- **Accepted**
