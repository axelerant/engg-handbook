# Implement Angular Routing

## Context

As we build more complex single-page applications (SPAs) with Angular, we need a way to manage navigation and lazy load modules to improve performance.

## Decision

We will implement Angular routing to handle navigation within our applications. This will allow us to:

- Define application routes in a centralized location.
- Lazy load modules to enhance performance by loading only the necessary parts of the application when needed.
- Enable deep linking and support for browser back/forward navigation.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Improved application performance through lazy loading.
  - Better user experience with seamless navigation.
  - Simplified route management and configuration.
- **Negative:**
  - Additional complexity in setting up and managing routes.
  - Potential initial performance overhead during the setup of routing configurations.

## Status

- **Accepted**
