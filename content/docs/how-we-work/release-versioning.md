# Release Versioning

We give attention to release versioning as it is the practice of assigning unique identifiers or version numbers to software releases, indicating changes, updates, or improvements made to the software. These version numbers typically follow a specific format or convention, allowing developers, users, and other stakeholders to understand the significance of each release and track the evolution of the software over time.

We adhere to the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) format, in line with Drupal's practice, for release versioning. This method assigns version numbers to software releases, with each number representing major, minor, and patch updates. Following this standardized approach ensures clarity and consistency in communicating changes to our products, facilitating seamless collaboration and understanding among our team members and users.

## Release Planning

Release planning involves collaborative efforts between teams and product owners to determine the "how," "when," and "what" of upcoming product increments. Regardless of project size or duration, we collaborate with our project managers for maintaining updated release plans for every project.

At the start of a project, features in the backlog are prioritized based on their importance. Top-priority items are typically essential for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), while others are planned incrementally in subsequent releases. A good release plan ensures clarity on scope, timelines, and the historical context of each release.

We emphasize making releases more frequent, automated, and less of a significant event. Updated release plans are documented and shared regularly with stakeholders to ensure alignment and smooth progression.

## Release Notes

We provide detailed release notes for each Release regardless of whether it's a major, minor or patch release. This provides clarity for all stakeholders on the changes made to the product in that release on what has been added new, what has been improved to existing features, any bug fixes made to the product and any additional changes done in the Release.
