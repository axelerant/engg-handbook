# How we work at Axelerant

While many development principles are universal, each individual develops their own style of programming and that might be somewhat different from another persons. We work in a team and sometimes these styles conflict with one another. To avoid losing precious energy and time in discussing this for each team we build, we are documenting some of the ways of working here.

There's another perspective. Everyone has a different experience and they may not be aware of all the pitfalls of a specific practice; things that might be obvious to more seasoned developers. Since we forget to talk about things that are obvious to us, this guide is meant to document out method so that it is clear to all.

## Are these perfect?

No. These methods are not perfect but these are ours. We understand the tradeoffs involved and have decided this to be the most appropriate method based on these factors.

1. The current technology landscape.
1. The tools and platforms we use.
1. Our knowledge about these technologies and platforms.

We welcome improvements to these processes and methods provided there is enough support. We also recognize that not all teams are the same and the most appropriate method may be different for such teams. Wherever possible, we try to document that within our context.

Again, if you find anything lacking in any of these pages, feel free to raise a pull request.
