## Local tools

Your choice of tools you use to write code or work with issues will determine how happy and productive, or frustrated and inefficient you are. This is why we build configuration for local tools within the project repository so that the entire team is working with the same tools and in the same environment.

### IDE's, shell, other utilities

We share and publish our preferred IDE's and configuration but are able to give an option to use your preferred IDE, shell, tools, and other utilities in most cases. We recommend a powerful enough macOS system configured for command line usage and PHPStorm for IDE but many teams use alternatives efficiently.

### Development environments

Development environments are trickier to maintain as per individual preferences and that is why the team usually opts for a single development environment (configured in the project repository). Our choice of development environments are Lando and DDEV and we have tooling to improve some of our processes for both.
