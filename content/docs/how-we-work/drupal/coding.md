At Axelerant, we prefer using community modules. But sadly, that doesn't always meet the requirements.

## Double check

Are you sure the module doesn't have a setting that will meet the requirement? They are sometimes hidden and not mentioned in the README.

## Hybrid approach

Can the work be reduced by using a community module? It is effective because the module will do the heavy lifting. It reduces the scope of tests as well.

The client wants to add "Like" buttons below the snippet of every content. It will send a notification to a third-party mobile application. `flag` module will do the most work. You only need to write the glue code for the notification.

## Reusability

If you have written a generic implementation, others in the project can use it very useful. Bonus - you can easily contribute it to the community. It can be in the form of a path or a new module!

## Contribution first

- You have figured out the problem in the module - submit a patch
- Someone needs help in a drupal.org issue queue, and you know the solution - go ahead and submit your comment
- You developed a generic solution to a problem. Cool! Let's submit it as a module
