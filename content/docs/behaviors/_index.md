# Behaviors we expect from each other

At Axelerant, we highly value the quality of the code delivered by the engineer. But it is equally important to note that we are not writing the code in a vacuum. You will collaborate with your peers, closely work with your manager and give demonstrations to the customer. That means behavioral traits become as important as your technical capabilities.

## We own everything in our world

Manager asked you to implement a feature.

- You take into account the areas of the application it will impact. 
- What are all possible scenarios the particular feature can fail? 
- What are the steps required to deploy it in production?

In a nutshell, you own the feature. You are most welcome to share suggestions on how to improve it.

You have some personal work during the day of deployment. Asking the team for help shows you have a high sense of ownership.

## We step up and speak up

## We demonstrate kindness

## Don't be a perfectionist
