# Behaviors we expect from each other

At Axelerant, we highly value the quality of the code delivered by the engineer. But it is equally important to note that you are not writing the code in a vacuum. You will collaborate with your peers, closely work with your manager and give demonstrations to the customer. That means behavioral traits become as important as your technical capabilities.
