# Behaviors we expect from each other

At Axelerant, we highly value the quality of the code delivered by the engineer. But it is equally important to note that you are not writing the code in a vacuum. You will collaborate with your peers, closely work with your manager and give demonstrations to the customer. That means behavioral traits become as important as your technical capabilities.

## We own everything in our world

Manager asked you to implement a feature.

- You take into account the areas of the application it will impact. 
- What are all possible scenarios the particular feature can fail? 
- What are the steps required to deploy it in production?

In a nutshell, you own the feature. You are most welcome to share suggestions on how to improve it.

You have some personal work during the day of deployment. You will be away. Asking the team for help shows you have a high sense of ownership.

## We step up and speak up

You are in the midst of a client meeting. There is a decision taken that is going to impact a specific area of the application. But, nobody has raised the concern.

There is a feeling of uncomfortableness during a discussion where you are finding a pause to speak. Or, you might think the issue is obvious, and the client will realize it later. These feelings will stop you from bringing up the concern in the meeting.

Shake off those feelings. Share your observations right away. At Axelerant, we highly value it when you do something outside your comfort zone.

## Being proactive

You are working on a task. You are stuck with a weird error. You are not sure what is causing it. You have spent hours on it, but you have not made progress.

Spending hours is not an efficient way. It might impact the deadline. You have given your best - that's it. Now it is time to [reach out to your peers]({{< ref "../principles/ask-for-help.md" >}}) for help.

## We demonstrate kindness

Your peer has accidentally deleted the content on production. Instead of being hard on the person, ask for their support to resolve the problem. You have empowered that person with your act of kindness.
