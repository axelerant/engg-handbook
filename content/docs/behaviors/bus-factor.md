> The "bus factor" is the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project before the project stalls due to the lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel.

A team lead must ensure a higher bus factor. At least two people in the team must know the project technically. They are knowledgeable enough to attend client meetings and answer their questions. The more, the better.
