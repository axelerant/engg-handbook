# We demonstrate kindness

> "The mark of a wild heart is living out the paradox of love in our lives. It's the ability to be tough and tender, excited and scared, brave and afraidâ€“all in the same moment. It's showing up in our vulnerability and our courage, being both fierce and kind." - _Braving the Wilderness_, Brene Brown

## Kindness, not niceness

If you're not speaking up because you don't want to _look_ like a bad person, you're probably being nice, not kind. You're witholding something that affects everyone else and that is not kindness. At Axelerant, kindness is required. It needs to be delivered in the most appropriate language and the most appropriate environment, but chosing not to say anything is not acceptable.
