# We demonstrate kindness

> "The mark of a wild heart is living out the paradox of love in our lives. It's the ability to be tough and tender, excited and scared, brave and afraid–all in the same moment. It's showing up in our vulnerability and our courage, being both fierce and kind." - _Braving the Wilderness_, Brene Brown

We write code and set up systems to solve people problems. To do that, we work with people and our work affects many more. Unlike machines, people don't use protocols to talk to each other and rely on each other. That happens with trust and kindness is the primary means to build that trust.

For example, your peer has accidentally deleted the content on production. Instead of being hard on the person, ask for their support to resolve the problem. You have empowered that person with your act of kindness.

## Kindness, not niceness

If you're not speaking up because you don't want to _look_ like a bad person, you're probably being nice, not kind. You're witholding something that affects everyone else and that is not kindness. At Axelerant, kindness is required. It needs to be delivered in the most appropriate language and the most appropriate environment, but chosing not to say anything is not acceptable.
