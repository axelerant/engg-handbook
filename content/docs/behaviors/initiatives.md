# We step up and speak up

> "They don't understand that Excellence isn't about working extra hard to do what you're told. It's about taking the initiative to do work you decide is worth doing." - _Poke the Box_, Seth Godin

When we take ownership of a system, we choose to do our best with it. Remaining quiet when we see a problem is not something we do. We actively seek the hardest problems that are worth solving and we speak up when we see something that affects our system.

You are in the midst of a client meeting. There is a decision taken that is going to impact a specific area of the application. But, nobody has raised the concern.

There is a feeling of uncomfortableness during a discussion where you are finding a pause to speak. Or, you might think the issue is obvious, and the client will realize it later. These feelings will stop you from bringing up the concern in the meeting.

Shake off those feelings. Share your observations right away. At Axelerant, we highly value stepping outside our comfort zone.
