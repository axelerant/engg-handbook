# We always learn

{{< blockquote author="Adam Grant" cite="Think Again" quote="Great thinkers don’t harbor doubts because they’re impostors. They maintain doubts because they know we’re all partially blind and they’re committed to improving their sight. They don’t boast about how much they know; they marvel at how little they understand. They’re aware that each answer raises new questions, and the quest for knowledge is never finished. A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn something from everyone they meet." >}}

No one knows everything. To remain good at our jobs, we have to keep learning. At Axelerant, we make learning a central activity to everything we do. Either by picking up new challenges where we intentionally learn something new or by facing an unexpected requirement where you have to catch up to be able to solve your problems, learning happens in all scenarios.

That is why we need to be intentional about learning. We provide resources and support in many forms such as:

- Knowledge sharing webinars
- Susbscriptions to learning services and resource websites
- Continuous Education Allowance
- Support from a training team

With this support, it is a core expectation on you that you will use these to keep learning and moving ahead.
