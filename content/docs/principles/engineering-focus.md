# Engineering Focus

Axelerant has traditionally been an Engineering focused company. We begin on strong fundamentals and aim to build a robust and useful solution. The solution needs to be robust so that our customers can trust it and it needs to be useful so that our customers derive value out of it. While we are focused on Engineering, we are still solving problems for people and that means we have to think of what our customers need.

## Boring Tech

Engineering focus does not mean we get obsessed with technology. We use technology to solve a problem and we will do that properly. We will use both proven technologies and cutting edge ones as long as they solve the problem in the best possible way. But if our choice of technology stops use from solving a problem, we stop using it and leave it aside for another day.
