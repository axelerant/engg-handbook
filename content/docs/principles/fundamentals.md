# Focus on Fundamentals

There's a saying that goes you can't build your home on an uneven foundation. This is strongly mirrored in many scientific disciplines and while software engineering is a lot more forgiving than those disciplines, it doesn't make it unimportant. It makes it even more important to stress on those fundamentals because one can survive in this industry for a long time without worrying about them. That's not who we are at Axelerant.

> We balance the value of getting started quickly with a robust understanding of the fundamentals.

## Understand the technology deeply {#technology}

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke

We are engineers and we dig below the magic to see what makes the technology work. "It just works that way" is not far from "It _always_ works that way," and that is not something we take for granted at Axelerant. We understand why things work the way they do. We learn and build our knowledge every day. Our customers rely on us to solve their technological problems and we can't do that without understanding the technology.

The above should not be read to mean that we obsess over technology. We use suitable abstractions to help us think about technology more effectively. But we are aware that there are abstractions and what they look like. We are aware of what they might mean for our choices of technology and how, ultimately, they affect the customer.

> Ours is a learning journey.

### Understand how computers work {#computers}

We write programs to tell computers how to solve a problem. To do that well, you have to understand how computers work. How does the computer interpret your code? How does it work with data? How does memory work? How do networks work? Each of these questions lead to deep rabbitholes and there are a lot more questions like these that we have to deal with.

You can't be productive if all you do is explore these rabbitholes. But you have to know enough of these topics to ask meaningful questions and learn.

### Understand how Internet works {#internet}

Axelerant focuses mainly on web development and understanding how Internet works is critical. What is Internet? How are the networks built? How do two computers on the opposite sides of the planet talk to each other? How does the web work? What is HTTP? How do browsers work? What are the common things browsers do to speed up a user's experience? The list is endless and you can only learn if you look out to learn.

### Understand how operating systems work {#os}

All computers, that is to say your laptop, or your phone, and the server you may be working with use an operating system. The code you write will run in that context. So you need to know enough about the operating system that affects your code. How does an operating system organize files? How does it deal with processes? How does it run long-running processes (such as servers)? How does it deal with memory management? How does it deal with security?

### Understand programming languages {#languages}

We use a language to talk to the computer and they come in all shapes and sizes. It's important you know what questions to ask to understand a programming language better. What paradigm does it follow? Does it enforce a type system? How does it find an entry-point in your code? How deeply does it let you interact with your machine? How does your code get invoked? What resources are available to your code while it's running?

#### Distinguish types of programming languages {#language-types}

Classifying programming languages according to their traits is a good way to understand what language would be a good choice for a problem. Languages often get classified based on their flow model and how they organize memory (functional, procedural, object-oriented). There are other ways to classify languages and it is useful to understand a variety of their types. Some of these are listed below:

- Procedural, object-oriented, or functional
- Interpreted or compiled
- High-level or low-level
- Server-side or client-side
- General or specialized

## Understand design patterns and SOLID principles

Change is the only constant. Making changes in software will become havoc if it is not well-designed. Some of the best software engineers came up with design patterns and SOLID principles after they kept repeating the same mistake. Understanding them will help you to write software that is more adaptable to change.

## Understand why we use anything {#anything}

It is easy to get lost in the world of technology and solve problems that don't exist. It is important to be reminded that all we do is to help our customers, either directly or indirectly.

> Understand the fundamentals and make a sound decision on what to use and how.

## Working with source code {#source-code}

All the code you work on must be in version control. We use git almost universally and you need to understand how it works and how to perform common actions using it (such as committing files, switching branches, merging branches, etc.) When leading teams, you also need to understand some of the more advanced actions such as resolving conflicts, rebasing, cherry-picking, and more. Fortunately, there are hundreds of resources to help you learn git and you can't go wrong in starting with the official book.

### Reading vs Writing code {#reading-code}

The code that you write will be read many more times and executed a lot more times. Optimize your code for reading and execution.
