# Know your tradeoffs

There will always be a moment when there are two or more choices, and you pick one. The situation happens more often in software development. At Axelerant, we value your decision. But it should have a reasoning behind it.

1. Is the solution adaptable to [change]({{< ref "fundamentals.md#design-principle" >}})?
1. Can it be delivered to the customer within the deadline?
1. Can it be picked up by anyone from your team in case you are away?

And there can be more. Our core value is to work as a team. So, [do not hesitate]({{< ref "ask-for-help.md" >}}) is review your decision with your peers.
