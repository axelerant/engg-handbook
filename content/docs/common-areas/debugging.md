# Debugging

Debugging is an important part of web development activity and probably will consume most of a 
web developer's time.  Hence, it is advisable to use and familiarise with the most
commonly available Debugging tools. 

In PHP web applications Xdebug is the most widely used debugger. This provides much more options while debugging
when compared to print and dump statements. Axelerant encourages the use of Xdebug with the aid of a supported IDE
like PHPStorm for faster debugging.
